# Neugence UI / UX Design Challenge

Welcome to our **UI/UX Design Challenge**! We're excited to see how you **enhance** and **improve** the [AceHub.ai](https://aceHub.ai) landing page. This challenge tests your **visual design**, **user experience thinking**, and **creative problem-solving** skills.

---

## 1. Fork This Repo
1. **Fork** our assignment repository: [Neugence Design Assignment](https://github.com/neugence/designAssignment)  
2. Once forked, clone it locally or work directly on your forked copy.

## 2. Complete the Assignment in Figma
You’ll be focusing on the **landing page** from [AceHub.ai](https://aceHub.ai), but we encourage you to **level up** the design.

### Core Tasks
- **Recreate or enhance** the AceHub.ai **landing page**: structure, layout, visuals, etc.  
- **Demonstrate** top-notch UX practices: layout consistency, typography, color usage, and intuitive user flows.  
- **Document** your design decisions and overall thought process.

### Additional UI Challenges
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Show how the landing page adapts on smaller screens (mobile/tablet breakpoints).
2. **Design System Elements**  
   - Create a mini style guide in Figma (colors, typography, button states, spacing, etc.).
3. **Accessibility Considerations**  
   - Consider color contrast and typography for optimal readability.
4. **Micro-Interactions**  
   - Propose at least one subtle interaction (hover states, button animations, transitions) to elevate user engagement.
5. **CTA Effectiveness**  
   - Ensure clear, persuasive calls-to-action, including hover/tap states.
6. **Iconography and Imagery**  
   - Choose or create icons/illustrations aligning with AceHub’s brand and design style.

Feel free to **personalize** these challenges as long as you demonstrate thoughtful UX/UI execution.

## 3. Create a Pull Request with Figma Link
Once you’re done, create a **Pull Request** in your forked repo containing only:
- A **Figma link** to your design (make sure it’s viewable).  
- Any brief notes you want to share (optional).

No code changes are necessary—just the link to your Figma work.

## 4. Interview & Review
- **Deep Dive Discussion**: We’ll go over your design decisions, user flows, and methodology during the interview.  
- **AI Tools**: Feel free to use AI tools for support or generating content. We care about how you think and structure your design, not just manual pixel pushing.
